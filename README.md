# LeftCenterRight
Windows Forms Application based on the Left Center Right game

This is my version of the family game called Left Center Right using C# and Windows Forms in Visual Studio. 
it is a chip and dice based game in which the person with the last chip who rolls a circle wins. 
I decided to create this as it is one of my favorite games to play with family and friends. 
I don't believe there's many examples of this game which is what really pushed me to finishing it.
I hope you enjoy playing it!
